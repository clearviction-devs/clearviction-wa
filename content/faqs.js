    summary: "What does it mean to vacate a conviction?",
    details: `Vacating a conviction is the process of clearing a conviction from your record so it is not visible to the public anymore. Vacating your conviction can remove that crime from some background checks, and you can say legally that you were never convicted of that crime.\n\nThe courts can still reference a vacated conviction in a future criminal proceeding, and not all convictions are eligible for vacation.`,

    summary: "Why should I consider vacating my conviction?",
    details:
      "If you are convicted of a crime, your criminal record will continue to show that conviction in background checks. Having a criminal record might negatively affect your housing, employment, and educational opportunities.\n\nIf you are experiencing this, vacating your conviction removes that crime from background checks, and you can say legally that you were never convicted of that crime. This can help you get access to housing, education, employment, volunteering opportunities, and more.",

    summary: "Does vacating a conviction make it disappear from my record?",

If a conviction was a domestic violence case, these records and indexes will still show the case type.\n\nInformation about the court records from the cases that led to the convictions are still public.
